CHUNK DOWNLOADS
==============================================
Chunk downloads are handled seperately from the threads that actually use the chunks. There is no way to request a particular chunk, rather
chunks are provided by the chunkmanager_cl at the algorithm's discression and are then made avaliable for use.

CHUNK STATUSES
==============================================
Chunk statuses can be used to determine what processes a chunk has gone through and which it has yet to encounter.
